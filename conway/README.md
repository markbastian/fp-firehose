# conway

A very basic implementation of Conway's Game of Life. Primary points are:
1. You can make stateful Clojure apps
2. The logic is separate from the app
3. The Game of Life is cool

## Installation

Download from http://example.com/FIXME.

## Usage

Assuming you have leiningen (http://leiningen.org) you can do one of th following:
1. lein clean
2. lein compile
3. lein run

or, buid an uberjar like so:
1. lein clean
2. lein compile
3. lein uberjar

Now look in your target/uberjar to find conway-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar. Double-click it or do java -jar conway-0.1.0-standalone.jar.
